<h3>I QUIT</h3>
<p>Once upon another time, four friends were sitting in a lawn; they were agitated by the power cut, mosquito bites and Gig's headache.
Suddenly Tau said 'I Quit', he was fed up of playing off beats in the band, as they were obsessed with it!<br />

Tau, a self taught Haryanavi bassist, always inspire band to make simple note to note music but Sushil being musically illiterate, always makes it a bit complicated.<br />
So Tau's words turned out to be the band's name later.<br />

Well talking about 'I quit', it's a punk rock band from Chandigarh, consist of four fucking PIA's<br />
Who always quit easy ways to do things and get themselves in troubled ways all the time.<br /><br /><br />

<h3>Axis-6</h3>
<p>	
AXIS 6 is a 4-piece metal band hailing from Allahabad (u.p INDIA). The band's lineup was completed in October '09.<br />


The members of this band had been playing in different bands before the formation of Axis 6.. So since it has'nt been long since our band came into picture , we don't have huge touring and gigging lists added to our accomplishments.. But our music is good, and we've been rigorously working on creating and bringing out the band's sound since quite some time now.. Presently we're working on around half a dozen of our singles with AXIS 6 and moving on ahead..<br /><br />

<h3>SILENCED</h3>
<p>Silenced hails from the city of Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh. Based in a town where there has hardly been a Rock Scene and never a Metal Scene, life was not easy and the band initially struggled due to lack of gigs, resources, support and Line Up changes since it's formation in 2006. <br />

They played their debut Gig at IIIT Allahabad's Annual Rock Competition "Incendiary" in 2006 and won "Best Band".<br />

The line-up which took them to the most success finally took shape in Mid-2008.<br />Since then, they have come a long way and have performed in every major college in the city and have since moved on to bigger competitions outside the city such as "Mary Jane Green Fields" - IIT Roorkee, Battle Rock Solid - Lucknow, "RAGE 2K9". They have also performed for Rock Street Journal's PubRock Fest.<br />

<h3>Sones-Aura</h3>
<p>going back down memory lane to the fall of 2008. auditions were called in the month of november for a new band to be formed in ciet' a place where rock music was never born and metalheads were a disgrace. the person behind this was a final year bca student, frustrated from the lack of support from the college to his greatest passion in life : music. only three guys auditioned and instantly a band was in the making. The reluctant crowd, the ignorant authorities should have been enough to break the morale of the band, but they all slogged. starting from nothing and a few shows in the college itself they all struggled for almost an year . the band was desperate for a pemanent bassist and found one almost an year later. it was then that sones aura became active in the chandigarh rock scene. since then there was no looking back and the band has performed in almost every single rock show in chandiagarh since then. it is just the begining of sones aura. the road ahead is gonna be tough but music is the cure of all hurdles.
